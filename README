This is my workings on the course http://dbwebb.se/htmlphp/ @ BTH.

Use the following to use this code:

git clone http://github.com/matslj/htmlphp.git kmom0X

...in order to clone into the directory kmom0X where X is a number from 1 to <to be filled in later>.

then do a:

git checkout vX.0

...where X is the same number as the directory number X mentioned above.

It is not necessary to clone into a structure ranging from kmom01 to kmom0<something>, but some links
which is referring to previous versions, will not work if the referenced kmom0X-catalog does not exist. 

If you only want to look at the final result just do a:

git clone http://github.com/matslj/htmlphp.git

Your're welcome!
